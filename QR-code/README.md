## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By this oppurtunity of completing this assignment (or) project given by the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to complete I have learned how to use flexbox efficiently and align the items properly and margin down those to the middle of the webpage.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://w3schools.com/) - This website helped me for alignin the content in middle of the page. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
