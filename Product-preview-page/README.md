## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components SaSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I improved my flexbox alignment and use and learnt responsive design using media query for mobile and desktop views.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools responsive design](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for learning how to use media query properly. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
